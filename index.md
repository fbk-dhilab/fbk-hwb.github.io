# The TreC Project source code repository
This repository contains the source code of the components of TreC (Trentino Citizens Clinical Record), a Personal Health Record platform that provides citizens with a repository to manage their own health information and data and a set of services to support the provision of assistance and care by helthcare professionals (e.g., monitoring of disease-related parameters by healthcare professionals). The project has been developed and implemented in three main stages (2008-2011, 2012-2014, 2016-2018) thanks to the concerted efforts of three Institutions: the Provincia Autonoma di Trento – PAT that defines and implements the health policy at local level, the regional healthcare trust Azienda Provinciale per i Servizi Sanitari - APSS the Fondazione Bruno Kessler – FBK, one of the main research stakeholders in the Trentino region. Over the years, those three institutions have made large investments in developing data infrastructures and strategies to support a common mission, that is, improving health and well being services provided to the general population following a systematic and sustainable approach, through the development and implementation of the TreC platform.

The TreC Platform is based on the concept of Personal Health Record (PHR) developed and defined by Markle Foundation1, the charitable organization that works to real- ize the potential of emerging communications media and information technology that address public needs. According to this definition, the PHR is "...an Internet-based set of tools that al- lows people to access and coordinate their lifelong information and make appropriate parts of it available to those who need it. PHRs offer an integrated and comprehensive view of health in- formation, including information people generate themselves [...], information from doctors [...] and information from their pharmacies and insurance companies." This definition stresses the importance of (i) an active role of the citizen/patient in managing his/her own PHR on one side and (ii) the role of the PHR platform as communication hub among different stakeholders. 

TreC is conceived as an interoperable information hub to improve citizens’ empowerment complemented by an ecosystem of mobile applications (apps) and web-based platform and dashboard for patients and medical doctors / health care staff. On the citizens’ side, the platform allows them to play an active role in the care and assistance process by guaranteeing collection and management of personal data (e.g., lifestyle data, parameters measured by personal devices), and (iii) data sharing with the health care staff for prevention and/or treatment purposes. In fact, TreC allows: 
1. prescription and personalization of certified apps available on the platform as tools for self-care and monitoring purposes;
2. tele-monitoring of patients with chronic diseases (for a specific, identified time-spam),
3. promotion of healthy lifestyles to prevent major chronic diseases, AND
4. planning and implementation of health care research using the data generated by patients (e.g., self-reported data or data from wearable devices).

## The TreC Platform

TreC adopts the classical three-tier architecture:
- The Presentation tier consists of a Web-based dashboard for healthcare professionals and system administrators, subdivided in three software modules (home, authentication and administration projects), and of several domain specific apps for patients;
- The Application logic tier consists of the set of microservices that implements the backend logic of TreC;
- The Data storage tier includes the data persistence mechanisms (database servers, file shares, etc.) and the data access layer that encapsulates the persistence mechanisms and exposes the data.

### TreC Microservices-based application logic tier
At the application tier level, TreC adopts a stateless microservice architecture, a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural style, which structures an application as a collection of fine-grained services that are highly maintainable and testable, loosely coupled, independently deployable and organized around business capabilities. Microservices communicate through lightweight protocols, and each service has its own database in order to be decoupled from other services. The decomposition of complex applications, like a PHR, using a microservice architecture improves their modularity, making the systems easier to design, understand, develop and test. In fact, this approach allows to parallelize development by enabling small autonomous teams to design, develop, deploy and scale their respective services independently, based on the functionality of the service in the overall architecture. It also enables continuous delivery and deployment by refactoring of individual services.

The implementation of TreC available here consists of 20 back-end microservices.

### TreC data storage tier 
At the data stroage level, TreC requires the installation of the following data management servers: 
-	[_MariaDB_](https://mariadb.org/), a relational (SQL) DB, used by the authorization system, which is a fundamental microservice for ensuring the compliance with the personal data protection code, and by other services that make extensive use of recursive queries and JOIN operator. Being one of the most time consuming and data-intensive operations, relational databases, which effi- ciently implement these operations, are needed. Besides MariaDB, currently the platform supports also Oracle. 
-	[_MongoDB_](https://www.mongodb.com/), a non-SQL document-oriented database, used mainly for storing clinical data. This choice is motivated by the flexibility offered by document-oriented databases in rep- resenting heterogeneous data models, typical of clinical data and personal observations. Moreover, MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time without impacting on the core structure of stored data. 
-	[_Redis_](https://redis.io), an in-memory database used as cache to maintain temporary data, like the session tokens and runtime computed data, to improve system performance.
-	[_MinIO_](https://min.io), an object storage server to handle unstructured data (photos, videos) used by the blob storage microservice to manage files attached to chat messages, personal notes, etc.
-	[_RabbitMQ_](https://www.rabbitmq.com), a message broker (queue manager) used for asynchronous communication be- tween microservices and between a microservice and the presentation layer. The asyn- chronous communication with the persistence mechanism is convenient for event-based action management (e.g., user data input) and management of peak loads and temporary downtime of a service.
