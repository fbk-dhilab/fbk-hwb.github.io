# The TreC Project source code repository
This repositories contain the source code of the components of TreC (Trentino Citizens Clinical Record) a Personal Health Record platform that provides citizens with a repository to manage their own health information and data and a set of services through which their data are used in the care process (e.g., monitoring of disease-related parameters by healthcare professionals). The project has been developed and implemented in three main stages (2008-2011, 2012-2014, 2016-2018) thanks to the concerted efforts of three Institutions: the Provincia Autonoma di Trento – PAT that defines and implements the health policy at local level, the regional healthcare trust Azienda Provinciale per i Servizi Sanitari - APSS the Fondazione Bruno Kessler – FBK, one of the main research stakeholders in the Trentino region. Over the years, those three institutions have made large investments in developing data infrastructures and strategies to support a common mission, that is, improving health and well being services provided to the general population following a systematic and sustainable approach, through the development and implementation of the TreC platform.

The TreC Platform is based on the concept of Personal Health Record (PHR) developed and defined by Markle Foundation1, the charitable organization that works to real- ize the potential of emerging communications media and information technology that address public needs. According to this definition, the PHR is "...an Internet-based set of tools that al- lows people to access and coordinate their lifelong information and make appropriate parts of it available to those who need it. PHRs offer an integrated and comprehensive view of health in- formation, including information people generate themselves [...], information from doctors [...] and information from their pharmacies and insurance companies." This definition stresses the importance of (i) an active role of the citizen/patient in managing his/her own PHR on one side and (ii) the role of the PHR platform as communication hub among different stakeholders. 

TreC is conceived as an interoperable information hub to improve citizens’ empowerment complemented by an ecosystem of mobile applications (apps) and web-based platform and dashboard for patients and medical doctors / health care staff. On the citizens’ side, the platform allows them to play an active role in the care and assistance process by guaranteeing collection and management of personal data (e.g., lifestyle data, parameters measured by personal devices), and (iii) data sharing with the health care staff for prevention and/or treatment purposes. In fact, TreC allows: 
1. prescription and personalization of certified apps available on the platform as tools for self-care and monitoring purposes;
2. tele-monitoring of patients with chronic diseases (for a specific, identified time-spam),
3. promotion of healthy lifestyles to prevent major chronic diseases, AND
4. planning and implementation of health care research using the data generated by patients (e.g., self-reported data or data from wearable devices).

## The TreC Platform

TreC adopts the classical three-tier architecture:
- The Presentation tier consists of a Web-based dashboard for healthcare professionals and system administrators (home, authentication and administration projects), and of several domain specific apps for patients;
- The Application logic tier consists of the set of microservices that implements the backend logic of TreC;
- The Data storage tier includes the data persistence mechanisms (database servers, file shares, etc.) and the data access layer that encapsulates the persistence mechanisms and exposes the data.
