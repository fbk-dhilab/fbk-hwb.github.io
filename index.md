# The TreC Project source code repository

This repository contains the source code of the components of TreC (Trentino Citizens Clinical
Record), a Personal Health Record platform that provides citizens with a repository to manage their
own health information and data and a set of services to support the provision of assistance and
care by helthcare professionals (e.g., monitoring of disease-related parameters by healthcare
professionals). The project has been developed and implemented in three main stages (2008-2011,
2012-2014, 2016-2018) thanks to the concerted efforts of three Institutions: the Provincia Autonoma
di Trento – PAT that defines and implements the health policy at local level, the regional
healthcare trust Azienda Provinciale per i Servizi Sanitari - APSS the Fondazione Bruno Kessler –
FBK, one of the main research stakeholders in the Trentino region. Over the years, those three
institutions have made large investments in developing data infrastructures and strategies to
support a common mission, that is, improving health and well being services provided to the general
population following a systematic and sustainable approach, through the development and
implementation of the TreC platform.

The TreC Platform is based on the concept of Personal Health Record (PHR) developed and defined by
Markle Foundation1, the charitable organization that works to real- ize the potential of emerging
communications media and information technology that address public needs. According to this
definition, the PHR is "...an Internet-based set of tools that al- lows people to access and
coordinate their lifelong information and make appropriate parts of it available to those who need
it. PHRs offer an integrated and comprehensive view of health in- formation, including information
people generate themselves [...], information from doctors [...] and information from their
pharmacies and insurance companies." This definition stresses the importance of (i) an active role
of the citizen/patient in managing his/her own PHR on one side and (ii) the role of the PHR platform
as communication hub among different stakeholders.

TreC is conceived as an interoperable information hub to improve citizens’ empowerment complemented
by an ecosystem of mobile applications (apps) and web-based platform and dashboard for patients and
medical doctors / health care staff. On the citizens’ side, the platform allows them to play an
active role in the care and assistance process by guaranteeing collection and management of personal
data (e.g., lifestyle data, parameters measured by personal devices), and (iii) data sharing with
the health care staff for prevention and/or treatment purposes. In fact, TreC allows:

1. prescription and personalization of certified apps available on the platform as tools for
   self-care and monitoring purposes;
2. tele-monitoring of patients with chronic diseases (for a specific, identified time-spam),
3. promotion of healthy lifestyles to prevent major chronic diseases, AND
4. planning and implementation of health care research using the data generated by patients (e.g.,
   self-reported data or data from wearable devices).

## The TreC Platform

TreC adopts the classical three-tier architecture:

- The Presentation tier consists of a Web-based dashboard for healthcare professionals and system
  administrators, subdivided in three software modules (home, authentication and administration
  projects), and of several domain specific apps for patients;
- The Application logic tier consists of the set of microservices that implements the backend logic
  of TreC;
- The Data storage tier includes the data persistence mechanisms (database servers, file shares,
  etc.) and the data access layer that encapsulates the persistence mechanisms and exposes the data.

### TreC Microservices-based application logic tier

At the application tier level, TreC adopts a stateless microservice architecture, a variant of the
service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural style, which structures an application as a
collection of fine-grained services that are highly maintainable and testable, loosely coupled,
independently deployable and organized around business capabilities. Microservices communicate
through lightweight protocols, and each service has its own database in order to be decoupled from
other services. The decomposition of complex applications, like a PHR, using a microservice
architecture improves their modularity, making the systems easier to design, understand, develop and
test. In fact, this approach allows to parallelize development by enabling small autonomous teams to
design, develop, deploy and scale their respective services independently, based on the
functionality of the service in the overall architecture. It also enables continuous delivery and
deployment by refactoring of individual services.

The implementation of TreC available here consists of 20 back-end microservices.

### TreC data storage tier

At the data stroage level, TreC requires the installation of the following data management servers:

- [_MariaDB_](https://mariadb.org/), a relational (SQL) DB, used by the authorization system, which
  is a fundamental microservice for ensuring the compliance with the personal data protection code,
  and by other services that make extensive use of recursive queries and JOIN operator. Being one of
  the most time consuming and data-intensive operations, relational databases, which effi- ciently
  implement these operations, are needed. Besides MariaDB, currently the platform supports also
  Oracle.
- [_MongoDB_](https://www.mongodb.com/), a non-SQL document-oriented database, used mainly for
  storing clinical data. This choice is motivated by the flexibility offered by document-oriented
  databases in rep- resenting heterogeneous data models, typical of clinical data and personal
  observations. Moreover, MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from
  document to document and data structure can be changed over time without impacting on the core
  structure of stored data.
- [_Redis_](https://redis.io), an in-memory database used as cache to maintain temporary data, like
  the session tokens and runtime computed data, to improve system performance.
- [_MinIO_](https://min.io), an object storage server to handle unstructured data (photos, videos)
  used by the blob storage microservice to manage files attached to chat messages, personal notes,
  etc.
- [_RabbitMQ_](https://www.rabbitmq.com), a message broker (queue manager) used for asynchronous
  communication be- tween microservices and between a microservice and the presentation layer. The
  asyn- chronous communication with the persistence mechanism is convenient for event-based action
  management (e.g., user data input) and management of peak loads and temporary downtime of a
  service.

## Trec Source Code

In this section the list of the source code projects of the TreC platform is provided, along with
the provision conditions. Code is licensed under EUPL 1.2 or later.

### Documentation

The source code repositories are provided without any detailed documentation on the microservice
functionalities, and wtihout any information on how it is structured, how it can be built, how it
could be configured, on which external services relies on, and how to deploy it.

### Build

No information about the build process is provided. No information on which libraries each
microservice relies on is provided.

The minimum required version to compile/run the code of a microservice is Java 8. No guarantees can
be given regarding the operation with any greater version of Java.

### Support and Updates

No further development support, updates or maintenance is provided after the first commit.

### Organization

The code is published in DHL-FBK GitHub organization:
[Digital Health Lab - FBK](https://github.com/fbk-hwb)
